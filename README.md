Hi, I am Amit Saini
    Well let me give you a short intro myself so you can know a little about me...
       Tbh i don't know why i decided to code neither it matter now but i thing for sure i am starting to love it,
       it feels like coding becomes a part of mylife... without it i feel empty just like your partner
