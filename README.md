## 🚀 About Me

"I'm just getting into coding, and honestly, I’m not sure how or why I started, but now it feels like I can’t imagine my life without it. It’s kinda like coding has become my partner — without it, something just feels off, like I’m missing a piece.

### 💻 Why Coding?
"Coding kinda happened by accident for me, but now it’s something I can’t imagine living without. It’s like this endless puzzle that I can’t stop working on, and every time I learn something new, I get even more hyped to see what’s coming next."
