## 🚀 About Me

I’m a passionate coder who is just starting out, and while I’m not entirely sure how or why I started coding, it has already become an integral part of my life. In fact, it feels like coding is my partner — without it, something feels missing.

### 💻 Why Coding?
Coding started as something I stumbled into, but now, it's something I can't imagine living without. It’s like a puzzle I can't stop solving, and with every new concept I learn, I feel more and more excited to see what’s next.

### 🔧 Technologies & Tools
- Languages: Javascript, C++
- Frameworks: Node.js(still learning!)
- Tools: Git, GitHub, VS Code

### 📝 Currently Learning
- Web development (React, Node.js)
- Data structures & algorithms
